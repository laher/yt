# yt

`yt` is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) processor in the spirit of [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed).

`yt` can work with multi-document YAML files, and can be used to generate YAML docs

`yt` is VERY experimental - please use with care.

## Docs

`yt`'s docs are hosted at https://www.laher.net.nz/yt/
